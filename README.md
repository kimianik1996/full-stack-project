# Grow Better: Final Capstone Project
Grow Better is my individual capstone project, developed to demonstrate the full range of skills acquired throughout my university program. This project was particularly challenging, as I was responsible for every stage—from planning to deployment—making it a true milestone in my data and software development journey.

# Project Overview
The focus of this project is to support small businesses across 19 cities in Metro Vancouver by providing a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) tool. It aims to empower small business owners and potential investors—especially those with limited budgets—to make informed decisions and improve profitability.
